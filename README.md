# PiperPython
Plot Piper waterquality diagrams using python
Piper plots are a useful way of presenting water quality information.
Here I attempt to convert Peeter's colour coded Piper diagram to a pandas based system that removes the need to have data in a predetermined format (the program reads the column headings) I also attempt to allow the plots some functionality to plot catagoraically with points coloured according to location
